Welcome to the ML-Projects Repo! 
This repo is a mixed bag repo of some of my personal projects for ML. 
Most notebooks have been made in a spur of the moment to explain concepts to colleagues or friends but mostly to brush up on skills.

#### Machine Learning
- I recommend checking out the Customer_Churn.ipynb notebook in the Supervised Learning Folder for a model comparison of the Telco Customer Churn Dataset.  (Used to explain to 173tech employees principles of Model selection)
