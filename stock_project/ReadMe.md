# Welcom to the Stock_Project Repo! 

This repo is where I will be testing code ideas for the TIKR REPO in terms of the Model Development side of things. 

This is likely to be a messy repo with scattered files, yet, each notebook should be a good demonstration of a new concept in one way or another.

Enjoy! 

Noel.

Noel To do: 
- Find out how TIKR can call from the prediction held locally/server side via api instead of running the model again. 
- Use DNN to do this and the models predictions stored in the models/ folder.
